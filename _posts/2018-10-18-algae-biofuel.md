It is predicted that in the future, production of diesel and gasoline could be
replaced by algae biofuel. Interest in farming algae to produce biodiesel and
other biofuels has developed in the energy sector. The good thing about algae
farming (algaculture) is that it can be done with minimal freshwater;
saline and wastewater can be used for [algae production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxyvVkeW7Nk).
It is recommended that algaculture should be done near heavy industries where it can help reduce carbon
dioxide emission by feeding CO<sub>2</sub> directly into the algae culture.
Biofuel is produced from the breakdown of the algae cell
structure. Algae can produce 60 times more oil per acre compared to land-based
plants.
