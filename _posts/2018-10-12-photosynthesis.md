Most algae are able to do [photosynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis).
During this process algae produce sugar (organic carbon) from CO<sub>2</sub> and water.
CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves in water in form of carbonic acid (HCO<sub>3</sub>):

<center>
  CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#8644; HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>
</center>
<p>   </p>


H<sup>+</sup> ions make water acidic (if there are many). When algae use up dissolved CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sup>+</sup> ions are reduced and the water becomes basic. We can measure this process as a change in pH value.
Take a small sample from some algae culture and add it to a pH indicator bag, check the colour with the code for pH. Feed the algae with CO<sub>2</sub> by blowing into the tube.
