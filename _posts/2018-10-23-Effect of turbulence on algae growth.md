Turbulence plays a significant role in the production of algae. Turbulence enhances
the movement of algae cells in fluids. Algae depend on light energy for photosynthesis, 
hence considering that light decreases exponentially with depth in fluids,
turbulence is essential for exposing the algae cells to light. Furthermore,
turbulence improves the exchange of carbon and oxygen masses between the atmosphere
and algae growth medium. Turbulent mixing also ensures continous supply of nutrients to the algae cells.
However, it is important to note that a compromise between
turbulence and light energy is required for optimum algae growth otherwise excessive
turbulence may kill the algae cells.
