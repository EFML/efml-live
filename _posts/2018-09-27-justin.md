<p>THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project inspired by H.O.R.T.U.S (see <a href="http://www.ecologicstudio.com/v2/project.php?idcat=7&idsubcat=71&idproj=115" target="_blank">here </a>)
The concept is simple: The earth is finite and so are it's resources. 
</p>

## So What?

Well the answer to this questions is actually fairly straight forward: We live on this planet, we eat, sleep and breathe the earth's resources. It goes without saying then that changes to the state of the planet will directly affect us as humans. Now it's easy to sit back and enjoy the ride, you know... go with the flow per say. The thing is though ... as active members of this planet _we_ can affect the outcome of _our_ situation.
