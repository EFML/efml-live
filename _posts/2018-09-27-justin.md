<p>THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project inspired by H.O.R.T.U.S (see <a href="http://www.ecologicstudio.com/v2/project.php?idcat=7&idsubcat=71&idproj=115" target="_blank">here </a>)
The concept is simple: The earth is finite and so are it's resources. 
</p>

## So What?

Well the answer to this questions is actually fairly straight forward: We live on this planet, we eat, sleep and breathe the earth's resources. It goes without saying then that changes to the state of the planet will directly affect us as humans.
