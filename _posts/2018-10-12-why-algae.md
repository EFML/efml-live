Algae are one of the oldest and most important organisms on earth.
Over billions of years they produced the oxygen that made our atmosphere breathable.
Today they still contribute about 50% to the earths oxygen production.
As primary producers algae are the basis of every aquatic food web,
the fish and seafood we eat depend on them.
Even our food grown and raised on land would not exist without algae,
since all land plants originate from one group of algae, green algae or chlorophytes.
