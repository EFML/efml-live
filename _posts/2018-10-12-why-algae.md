Algae are one of the oldest and most important organisms on earth, we would not exist without them.
Over 100 millions of years they produced the oxygen that made our atmosphere breathable.
Today they still contribute more than 50% to the earths oxygen production.
As primary producers algae are the basis of every aquatic food web,
the fish and seafood we eat depend on them.
Even our food grown and raised on land would not exist without algae,
since all land plants originate from one group of algae, green algae or chlorophytes.
