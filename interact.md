title: Interact with THE.EARTH.LIVE
---

THE.EARTH.LIVE evolves around algae because [our lives depend on algae]({{site.url}}/why-algae). We need __YOU__ to contribute to the project. The algae in the bioreactors need to be mixed, __YOU__ can slightly squeeze and shake bags and bottles. Algae need to be fed with CO<sub>2</sub>, __YOU__ can blow into the tubes to feed them. Scan different QR codes to learn more about algae. Tell your friends, __tweet__ about THE.EARTH.LIVE @efml_ukzn using #EarthLiveUKZN.

__THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project by students and staff from Civil Engineering at UKZN__ [(Our Team)]({{site.url}}/earthlive_team)
