title: Interact with THE.EARTH.LIVE
---

THE.EARTH.LIVE evolves around algae because [our lives depend on algae]({{site.url}}/why-algae). We need __YOU__ to contribute to the project.

  - algae need to be mixed -- __YOU__ can carefully squeeze and shake bags and bottles
  - algae need to be fed with CO<sub>2</sub> -- __YOU__ can blow into the tubes to feed them
  - learn more about algae -- __YOU__ can scan different QR codes
  - tell your friends -- __YOU__ can tweet about THE.EARTH.LIVE @efml_ukzn using #EarthLiveUKZN

__THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project by students and staff from Civil Engineering at UKZN__ [(Our Team)]({{site.url}}/earthlive_team)
