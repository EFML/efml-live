<p>THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project inspired by H.O.R.T.U.S (see <a href="http://www.ecologicstudio.com/v2/project.php?idcat=7&idsubcat=71&idproj=115" target="_blank">here </a>)
The concept is simple: The earth is finite and so are it's resources. How we use and exploit these resources will directly impact upon us.

We are part of the earth... the earth is a part of us.
</p>

### So What?

Well the answer to this question is actually fairly straight forward: We live on this planet, we eat, sleep and breathe the earth's resources. It goes without saying then that changes to the state of the planet will directly affect us as humans. Now it's easy to sit back and enjoy the ride, you know... go with the flow per say. The thing is though ... as active members of this planet _we_ can affect the outcome of _our_ situation. That is the essence of _our_ project: To _inspire_ and _remind_ students/parents/brother/sisters that we are able to affect our realization.

### Installation
THE.EARTH.LIVE evolves around algae because [our lives depend on algae]({{site.baseurl}}/why-algae). Everybody can contribute to the project. The algae in the bioreactors need to be mixed, you can squeeze and shake bags and bottles. Algae need to be fed with CO<sub>2</sub>, you can blow in the tubes to feed them. Tell your friends, tweet about THE.EARTH.LIVE @efml_ukzn using #EarthLiveUKZN.
