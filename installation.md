THE.EARTH.LIVE evolves around algae because [our lives depend on algae]({{site.url}}/why-algae). Everybody can contribute to the project. The algae in the bioreactors need to be mixed, you can slightly squeeze and shake bags and bottles. Algae need to be fed with CO<sub>2</sub>, you can blow into the tubes to feed them. Tell your friends, tweet about THE.EARTH.LIVE @efml_ukzn using #EarthLiveUKZN.

__THE.EARTH.LIVE is a project by students and staff from Civil Engineering at UKZN__ [(Our Team)]({{site.url}}/earthlive_team)
